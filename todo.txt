- Append results not working
- Do we need to store the results so we can move the results view aroung (tricky issues)
- Selecting a different kernel from the kernel list doesn't seem to activate it
- Not getting the option to Shutdown the notebook
- When starting a newnotebook, we need to display the notebook in the statusbar (user can then kill it) (use this octicon '.octicon-book')
- Handle closing of results view (when closed, clear the buffered results)
- Look at existing issues
